54,"New Addition - Acne Studios' Latest Collection Is Made Entirely Out of Repurposed Fabrics","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Acne<a href=""http://hypebeast.com/tags/acne-studios""> </a>Studios&nbsp;has officially released its third&nbsp;sustainability-focused collection. The adventure-focused pieces in this particular series are completely made out of repurposed fabrics from leftover Acne Studios’ garments from previous seasons.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The capsule is crafted to provide fashionable, yet functional pieces for the hiking world. Additionally, the utilitarian garments are constructed with a tie-dyed pattern, giving the pieces their unique psychedelic foray. The&nbsp;outerwear&nbsp;pieces are produced using nylon fabrics, while the dye used to create a contemporary rendition of the camouflage design is done through environmentally certified dyes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This season’s sustainability capsule is genderless and multi-seasonal. Three types of fabrics are uniquely merged, transformed and repurposed to create light nylon garments such as in bright pink or coral red. For more heavyweight nylon, the cotton-blend ripstop in khaki green or almond brown offers a more structured silhouette. With Acne shoes you will wrap up the hike-inspired set, that goes with the long-or shoot hooded jacket, short-sleeved trek shirt, trousers, shorts and neck- essential to your next adventure outfit.</p>

<p>On this hoops-themed piece, three tones are brought to the table in terms of coloring for its upper half. Landing on the collars, quarter paneling and toe boxes is a drab olive green, while a clean white hue cascades over the surrounding overlays for brighter contrasting. From there, bursts of orange stand out atop the&nbsp;Nike&nbsp;branding on the tongues and heels, the Swooshes as well as the “NY vs NY” logo that is embroidered into the lateral heels.
